1) dimension reduction, where p - genes, and cells are data points
2) color cells according to specific gene expression. Gata2 - range of Blue.
Some other gene - range of red. and etc. Range is bassed on expression level in
this cell.

3) add variance explanation based on components - cross validation


Correlation
1) Consider clusters of genes after reduction of cells


Filtering data
1) number of 0 cells and genes influence on pca alot
2) number of genes does not influence so much


Do an analysis of variance of pca and cleaning


before t-sne decrease dimension with pca

how to chose pca and tsne components number



x = pd.DataFrame(np.arange(1, 10))
df = pd.concat([x, x, x, 2*x], axis = 1)
df.columns = ["x", "y", "c1", "c2"]

import matplotlib.colors
cmap = matplotlib.colors.LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list("", ["red"])
plt.scatter(df['x'], df['y'], cmap = "Blues", c = df['c1'], vmin = 1, vmax= 10)
plt.show()

## Do a clustering analysis:
Get indecies of cells for every clsuter and then create new expressions
and do same analysis
