single cell experiment analysis
input:
        - raw fastq for a single cell (might be for different conditions)
        - single/paired end reads, e.g. R1, R2
        - several lanes, e.g. L01, L02
        - umi - label on ends of reads
        - spike-in - known amounts of rna from a set of known transcripts

output:
        - expression column vector: row - gene, column - expression quantity for the cell
        - expression matrix - concatenation of column vectors for all cells

necessary files to get an expression matrix:
        - .fa - reference genome fasta file. Contains description of chromosomes
           Used in: STAR 
        - .gtf - contains information about genes for every chromosome
           Used in: STAR
                    QoRTs.jar 
                    geneBody_coverage.py
        - .bed - similar to .gtf but with different structure
           Used in: geneBody_coverage.py - replacement of .gtf
                    split_bam.py
        - .chrom.sizes - size of chromosomes
           Used in: bam2wig.py

procedure:
        1. QC of raw files
        2. Alignment
        3. QC of aligned files
        4. Expression matrix
        5. QC of expression matrix

# QC of raw files
Software: FASTQC  - generates an html output
          MultiQC - combine all html files in one report

Manual: FASTQC - http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/

Problems:
        1. Abundance of low-quality scores in first posititons (transient problem)
        2. Decrease in quality in last positions (general degradation)
        3. Proportion of nucleotides is not the same
        4. GC content is not normally distributed (with meand and variance similar to the reference transcriptome)
        5. Many dublicated reads (not few). However, in several sources it says,
           it is ok to have high percentage of duplicsates for RNA-seq

Solutions:
        1. not trim
        2. trim
        3. Might be ok for single cell rna
        4. 
        5. Might be ok, since experiment is focused to catch the expression of specific genes.
        
# Alignment
Software: STAR: 1. Generate indices
                2. Alignment
                3. Bam transformation
                4. Coordinate sorting

--outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate  - to make a sorted bam file as an output

several lanes:
you can use
--readFilesIn Read1a.gz,Read1b.gz Read2a.gz,Read2b.gz
to map multiple lanes "a","b" ... In this list comma separates different lanes of the same mate (1st or 2nd), while space separates the mates.

# QC of alignment
Software: RSeQC

Statistical measures:
            1. total number of reads
            2. number of transcripts seqnced or detected
            3. proportion of uniquely mapping reads
            4. proportion of reads mapping to annotated exonic regions
Low numbers are indicative of sample degradation and/or bias
